# Deployment Test - Force Rebuild

This file is created to force a fresh Render deployment.

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-29 15:55 CET
**Commit**: ded9c92
**Changes**: Added NEXT_PUBLIC_FORCE_SAMPLE="true"
**Expected**: Dashboard should show 67.4B kr immediately

If you're still seeing "..." after this deployment, there might be:
1. Render caching issues
2. Build configuration problems  
3. Environment variable propagation delays

**Debug Steps**:
- Check Render dashboard for build logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Consider manual environment variable configuration in Render UI
