## Terms of Use & Robots

- Review the latest Terms of Use and robots.txt directives for each provider before running the scrapers outside a local development environment.
- Stop scraping immediately if asked by the upstream providers.
- Do not run automated scraping faster than a polite human browsing rate.

```

Replace the contact email before using outside local development.

## Data Retention

- Store captured listing data responsibly and delete upon request.
- Retain only the snapshot history required for analytics and debugging.

## Liability
