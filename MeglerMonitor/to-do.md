Highlights

Added full-featured scraper package with shared normalization, jittered HTTP clients, CSV snapshots, and Postgres inserts wired through CLI flags (scraper/run.py:1, scraper/scrape_dnb.py:1, scraper/scrape_hjem.py:1, scraper/utils.py:1).
Delivered Fastify API with CORS + rate limiting, Postgres/query helpers, sample fallbacks, and migrate script covering listings, metrics, and aggregation endpoints (api/src/index.ts:1, api/src/config.ts:1, api/src/routes/listings.ts:1, api/src/routes/metrics.ts:1, api/src/routes/agg.ts:1, api/src/sample.ts:1, api/src/migrate.ts:1).
Built Next.js 14 dashboard with SWR data layer, filterable overview KPIs, top broker/chain tables, growth deltas, and reusable UI primitives (web/app/page.tsx:1, web/lib/api.ts:1, web/lib/agg.ts:1, web/components/kpi-card.tsx:1, web/components/filters.tsx:1, web/components/delta-list.tsx:1).
Implemented broker deep-dive view with historical trend chart plus data hub export screen for snapshot metadata (web/app/broker/[slug]/page.tsx:1, web/components/line-chart.tsx:1, web/app/data/page.tsx:1).
Provisioned infra with Dockerfiles, compose stack, SQL migration, Render manifest, CI workflows, env templates, and compliance guidance (infra/docker-compose.yml:1, infra/Dockerfile.api:1, infra/Dockerfile.web:1, infra/Dockerfile.scraper:1, infra/migrations/001_init.sql:1, infra/render.yaml:1, .github/workflows/ci.yml:1, .github/workflows/scraper-nightly.yml:1, LEGAL.md:1, .env.example:1).
- Added commission analytics (estimated commission per listing, materialized view, API `/api/agg/commissions/*`, dashboard rankings) covering Phase 2 requirements (infra/migrations/002_add_commission.sql:1, api/src/routes/commissions.ts:1, web/components/commission-table.tsx:1).
- Phase 3 in progress: listings now carry `district` + `role`, API exposes advanced filters and broker detail endpoints, dashboard features expanded filter panel and broker insights (infra/migrations/003_phase3_filters.sql:1, scraper/src/scraper/scrape_hjem.py:1, scraper/src/scraper/scrape_dnb.py:1, api/src/routes/listings.ts:1, api/src/routes/broker.ts:1, api/src/routes/agg.ts:1, web/app/page.tsx:1, web/app/broker/[slug]/page.tsx:1).
Next Steps

- ✅ pnpm installs complete in `api/` and `web/`; `pnpm --dir api db:migrate` executed inside the running container (schema ready).
- ✅ Stack verified via `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d`; `http://localhost:8000/api/health` returns `{ok:true}` and the dashboard renders.
- ✅ Ran `docker compose run --rm scraper` (wrapper around `python -m scraper.run --all`); snapshot saved to `out/raw` and DB insert attempted (0 rows returned due to empty upstream response).
- ✅ Updated `.env` (scraper UA + allowed origins) and `LEGAL.md` with contact email `ops@megler-monitor.no`; remember to add production secrets (DATABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE, etc.) in Render/Vercel dashboards prior to deploying.
- ✅ Commission Phase 2 delivered — run `pnpm -C api db:migrate && pnpm -C api db:refresh` after pulling to add `commission_est` and refresh `broker_commission_stats`.
- ☐ Re-run `docker compose run --rm scraper` post-migration to populate `district`/`role` data for fresh analytics.

docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml run --rm scraper: for scraping the websites

### 🔧 **Prompt for Copilot — “Phase 2: Commission & Ranking Metrics”**

> **Goal:**
> Extend the existing **MeglerMonitor** project to include *commission-based analytics per broker and per agency*.
> We already collect property listings from DNB Eiendom and Hjem.no with fields: `price`, `broker`, `chain`, `status`, `published`, etc.
> Now we want to calculate estimated **commission revenue per broker**, build rankings, and expose this in both the API and dashboard.

---

### 🧠 Business logic

* The metric “**Total market value**” (sum of `price`) is not that meaningful alone.
  What we actually want is to estimate **commissions** — how much each broker likely earns.

* For each listing:

  * Estimate commission using an adjustable rate (default = 1.25 %, `COMMISSION_RATE = 0.0125`).
  * Add a new derived column `commission_est = price * COMMISSION_RATE`.
  * If we later manage to scrape *real commission data* from DNB’s or Hjem’s listing APIs (e.g. field like `"commission": { "amount": ... }`), prefer that value.
  * Store both in DB and CSV.

* For each **broker**:

  * Count number of listings (active + sold).
  * Calculate:

    * `avg_commission` = mean(commission_est)
    * `total_commission` = sum(commission_est)
    * `median_price` (optional)
  * Example:

    ```
    Fredrik Horntvedt
      15 listings × avg 110 000 NOK = total 1.65 M NOK
    ```

* For **rankings**:

  * Build sorted leaderboards:

    * `top_brokers_by_total_commission`
    * `top_brokers_by_avg_commission`
    * `top_brokers_by_count`
  * Also compute “growing/falling” based on commission trend:

    * Compare total commission in the last 30 days vs previous 30 days (like before with prices).

---

### 🧩 API additions (TypeScript / Fastify)

Add new endpoints under `/api/agg/`:

```ts
GET /api/agg/commissions/brokers?window=12m
→ [
  { broker: string,
    chain: string,
    listings: number,
    total_commission: number,
    avg_commission: number }
]

GET /api/agg/commissions/chains?window=12m
→ same aggregated by chain

GET /api/agg/commissions/trends?nowDays=30
→ “growing” and “falling” brokers by delta of total_commission
```

All endpoints must return values in **NOK**, formatted integers (no decimals).

---

### 💾 Database changes

Add to the existing `listings` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE listings
  ADD COLUMN commission_est BIGINT;
```

and populate it in the scraper step (price × rate).
Later, if you scrape true commission values, overwrite `commission_est` with the actual amount.

Create a **materialized view** or cached table for broker aggregates:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW broker_commission_stats AS
SELECT
  broker,
  chain,
  COUNT(*)          AS listings,
  SUM(commission_est) AS total_commission,
  AVG(commission_est) AS avg_commission,
  MAX(snapshot_at)  AS last_snapshot
FROM listings
GROUP BY broker, chain;
```

---

### 💻 Web dashboard (Next.js / Tailwind)

* Add a new section **“Commission Rankings”** below the KPI cards.

  * Table: `# | Broker | Chain | Listings | Avg Commission | Total Commission`.
  * Support sorting (clickable headers).
  * Use the existing currency formatter `fmtNOK`.
* Show small chips:

  * 🔼 if total commission increased vs previous month.
  * 🔽 if decreased.
* Optional KPI cards:

  * “Top broker avg commission”
  * “Top broker total commission”
  * “Average commission per listing (overall)”
* Graph: bar chart showing top 10 brokers by total commission.

---

### ⚙️ Implementation details

* In scraper:

  ```python
  COMMISSION_RATE = 0.0125
  df["commission_est"] = (df["price"].astype(float) * COMMISSION_RATE).round(0)
  ```
* When saving to DB, include the new column.
* In API, reuse the existing aggregation pipeline but operate on `commission_est`.
* For trend calculation: reuse `window_split(df, now_days=30)` but aggregate on `commission_est` instead of `price`.

---

### 📦 Deliverables

* Updated scraper that stores `commission_est`.
* SQL migration adding the column.
* API routes `/api/agg/commissions/*`.
* Web dashboard section showing commission leaderboards and trends.
* All values formatted in NOK, with thousands separators.
* Works end-to-end via Docker (`docker compose up`).

---

If possible, also prompt Copilot to generate:

```bash
# Run migration + refresh view
pnpm -C api db:migrate
pnpm -C api db:refresh
```


how to restart api: docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml restart api



NEXT STEP (2):

“Phase 3: Filters, Segmentation & Broker Focus”

> **Goal:**
> Expand the MeglerMonitor project with richer filtering, segmentation, and focus on *individual brokers*.
> Improve how we explore data (price ranges, property types, cities/districts), and polish how numbers are displayed (e.g., shorten 1 574 000 → 1.57 m).

---

### ✅ Development Checklist

#### 1. 🔍 **Filtering and segmentation**

* [x] ✅ Add filters for **property type** (`enebolig`, `leilighet`, `rekkehus`, etc.) using existing `property_type` field.
* [x] ✅ Add **price range filters** (0–5 mill, 5–10 mill, 10–20 mill, >20 mill).
  Example:

  ```python
  price_bins = pd.cut(df["price"], bins=[0,5e6,10e6,20e6,1e9], labels=["0–5 M","5–10 M","10–20 M","20 M+"])
  ```
* [x] ✅ Expose these filters in the dashboard UI (dropdowns or sliders).
* [x] ✅ Allow combining filters freely (e.g., “Oslo + Leilighet + 5–10 mill”).

#### 2. 🧑‍💼 **Broker-level analytics**

* [x] ✅ Add a **dedicated broker detail page** `/broker/[slug]` that shows:

  * [x] ✅ All active/sold listings for that broker.
  * [x] ✅ Avg. price, total value, avg. commission, total commission.
  * [x] ✅ Listing type breakdown (pie chart: enebolig vs leilighet etc.).
  * [x] ✅ Commission trends (line or bar chart over last 6–12 months).
* [x] ✅ Differentiate **megler** vs **fullmektig** roles in all tables and filters.
  Use existing classifier logic:

  ```python
  if "fullmektig" in title.lower(): role = "Fullmektig"
  elif "megler" in title.lower(): role = "Megler"
  ```
* [x] ✅ Add an optional **role filter** (checkbox or select: [Megler, Fullmektig, Oppgjør, Annet]).

#### 3. 🏙️ **Geographic refinement**

* [x] ✅ Introduce **district-level filtering** for large cities (starting with Oslo).
* [x] ✅ Create a mapping from postal codes or areas to districts:

  ```
  0160–0179 → Sentrum
  0450–0469 → St. Hanshaugen
  0370–0379 → Vestre Aker
  ```
* [x] ✅ Add a new derived column `district` during data normalization.
* [x] ✅ Expose a “District” dropdown in filters that only appears when `city == "Oslo"`.
* [x] ✅ Allow searching “Nordvik Oslo” → returns all brokers in Nordvik with any listings in Oslo, without manually checking individual offices.

  * Implement fuzzy matching by chain name + city in API (e.g., case-insensitive LIKE match).

#### 4. 💅 **UI/UX improvements**

* [x] ✅ Format large NOK numbers with compact notation:

  ```ts
  export const fmtCompactNOK = (n:number) =>
    new Intl.NumberFormat('no-NO',{style:'currency',currency:'NOK',notation:'compact',maximumFractionDigits:2}).format(n)
  // 1 574 000 → 1,57 mill. kr
  ```
* [x] ✅ Add tooltips or hover for exact values.
* [x] ✅ Improve broker table visuals (rounded badges, compact columns).
* [x] ✅ Optional: show ranking icons 🥇🥈🥉 next to top brokers.
* [x] ✅ Keep consistent styling between dashboard and detail views.

#### 5. ⚙️ **API updates**

* [x] ✅ Extend `/api/listings` to support filters:

  * `city`, `district`, `price_min`, `price_max`, `property_type`, `role`.
  * Support combined queries: `/api/listings?city=Oslo&chain=Nordvik&price_max=10000000`.
* [x] ✅ Add `/api/broker/:name` endpoint returning:

  * Broker info, total/avg commission, listings (grouped by type and district).
* [x] ✅ Add `/api/agg/districts?city=Oslo` for top-performing brokers and chains by district.

#### 6. 📈 **Data enrichment**

* [x] ✅ On scrape/parse, try to infer `district` from postal code.
* [x] ✅ Add and persist these new columns:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE listings
    ADD COLUMN district TEXT,
    ADD COLUMN role TEXT;
  ```
* [x] ✅ When merging CSV → DB, fill missing `city` or `district` from address strings using regex or mapping file (`data/oslo_districts.json`).

7. 🧪 **Validation & UX polish**

* [x] ✅ Ensure filters persist across navigation.
* [x] ✅ Ensure that combined filters (e.g. "Oslo + Nordvik + Leilighet") return correct subset.
* [x] ✅ Optimize API queries with indexes on `(city, chain, district)`.
* [x] ✅ Add a “Reset filters” button.
* [x] ✅ Add a “Broker Summary” widget on top: name, total listings, avg commission, top area.

---

Deliverables

* Extended API and DB schema with `district`, `role`, and filterable fields.
* Updated web UI with advanced filters and compact NOK formatting.
* New broker detail page with trends and type breakdown.
* District-level analytics for Oslo.
* Improved search experience (“Nordvik Oslo” → all brokers under Nordvik in Oslo).
* Working compact number formatting (1.57 m style).
* Updated documentation for new filters and endpoints.



NEXT STEP (3):
“Phase: Dashboard-first with Powerful Filters & Ranked Brokers”

> **Goal**
> Build a production-ready **dashboard-first** web app that always opens on an Overview dashboard and lets users filter by **City**, **District**, **Broker role/title**, **Property segment** (leilighet, enebolig, rekkehus, nybygg, etc.), and **# sold**.
> The main output is a **ranked list of brokers** based on the active filters.

### ✅ Checklist (implement in this order)

#### 1) Data model & inputs

* [x] ✅ Ensure each listing has:
  `source, listing_id, title, address, city, district, chain, broker, broker_role, property_type, status, price, published_dt, last_seen_at, is_sold(bool)`
  (Derive `district` during normalize; infer `is_sold` from status like “solgt/sold”.)
* [x] ✅ Add computed fields:
  `price_bucket` (0–5M, 5–10M, 10–20M, 20M+), `segment` (apartment/leilighet, house/enebolig, row/rekkehus, newbuild/nybygg).
* [x] ✅ Indexes in DB (if using DB):
  `(city), (city,district), (broker), (chain), (broker_role), (segment), (is_sold), (published_dt)`.

#### 2) API (TypeScript/Fastify or Next.js API routes)

* [x] ✅ `GET /api/listings` with filter params (all optional):
  `city, district, chain, broker, broker_role, segment, price_min, price_max, only_sold (bool), min_sold_count, since, until, source[]`.
* [x] ✅ `GET /api/agg/brokers` → **ranked brokers** under current filters. Returns:

  ```ts
  [{ broker, chain, role, count_active, count_sold, total_value, avg_value }]
  ```
* [x] ✅ `GET /api/meta/filters` → distinct values for UI (cities, districts per city, roles, segments).
* [ ] (Optional) `GET /api/agg/districts?city=Oslo` for district level stats.

#### 3) Dashboard (Overview) — default landing page

* [ ] **Filter panel (left/top):**

  * City (Select) → loads District (dependent Select).
  * District (Select; disabled until City chosen).
  * Role/Title (Select: Megler, Fullmektig, Oppgjør, Annet).
  * Segment (Chips: Leilighet, Enebolig, Rekkehus, Nybygg, etc.).
  * “Only sold” (toggle) and “Min # sold” (slider).
  * Reset filters button.
* [ ] **KPI row (cards):**

  * Total turnover (filtered): sum(price) — compact NOK (e.g., 1,57 m).
  * Active brokers (filtered): unique brokers.
  * # Sold (filtered): count of `is_sold == true`.
  * Avg price (filtered).
* [ ] **Ranked Brokers table (core output):**

  * Default sort: **Total value (desc)**.
  * Columns: `# | Broker | Chain | Role | Active | Sold | Avg value | Total value`.
  * Row click → `/broker/[slug]`.
  * Compact NOK formatting; hover shows exact NOK.
* [ ] **Ranked Chains/Offices** (secondary table) — same metrics grouped by `chain`.

#### 4) Filtering logic (server or client)

* [ ] Apply filters to base listings first.
* [ ] Derive **ranked brokers** by grouping filtered listings:

  ```ts
  groupBy(broker, chain, role) → {
    count_active, count_sold,
    total_value = sum(price),
    avg_value = mean(price)
  }
  ```
* [ ] Sorting modes (toggle on table header): total_value, avg_value, count_sold, count_active.

#### 5) Compact number formatting (NOK)

* [ ] Utility:

  ```ts
  export const fmtNOKCompact = (n:number) =>
    new Intl.NumberFormat('no-NO', {
      style:'currency',
      currency:'NOK',
      notation:'compact',
      maximumFractionDigits:2
    }).format(n);
  ```
* [ ] Use compact values in tables/KPIs; show full value in tooltip/title.

#### 6) Districts for big cities (Oslo first)

* [ ] Add `district` mapping during normalization (postal code → district map).
* [ ] API should return districts per selected city for the District filter.
* [ ] In UI, District Select appears only after City is chosen (e.g., Oslo).

#### 7) Search UX

* [ ] Global search box: free-text matches `broker`, `chain`, `city`, `district`.
  Example: typing “Nordvik Oslo” returns all **brokers in chain=Nordvik** with listings in **Oslo**, without manually ticking offices.

#### 8) Broker detail page `/broker/[slug]`

* [ ] Header with avatar (initials), broker name, chain, role, KPIs (active, sold, total/avg value).
* [ ] Tabs:

  * Listings (cards or table; obey global filters except broker).
  * Segments breakdown (pie bar: leilighet/enebolig…).
  * (Optional) Commission analytics if available later.

#### 9) UX polish

* [ ] Dark theme, rounded cards, sticky table headers, skeleton loaders, empty states.
* [ ] Badges for Role and Segment in tables.
* [ ] “Reset filters” clears querystring & state.

#### 10) Validation

* [ ] Unit tests for agg functions (grouping & sorting).
* [ ] API returns stable shapes; handle empty results gracefully.
* [ ] Performance: paginate large tables; debounce search.

### 📦 Deliverables

* Working **Overview dashboard** that **always** opens first.
* Fully functional filters (City → District, Role, Segment, # Sold).
* **Ranked brokers** table reflecting active filters.
* Compact NOK formatting (1.57 m style) + exact value tooltips.
* Broker detail page route.
* API endpoints for listings, broker aggregation, and filter metadata.
* Docs/readme explaining filters & ranking logic.


NEXT STEP - Broker Profile Card Implementation

* [x] Property type mix, prisnivå og geografisk fokus presentert i kortet.
* [x] Utvikling siste 90 dager (nå vs tidligere) synlig i dedikert modul.
* [x] Peers-seksjon med relevante sammenlignbare meglere.
* [x] «Du vil også like»-seksjon med anbefalinger.
* [x] Broker metadata (erfaring, aktiv siden) vist øverst i kortet.
* [x] Fremhever høyvolum-meglere med badge.
* [ ] Integrasjon mot eksterne profiler (LinkedIn) for alder/ekstra metadata.
