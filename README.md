Project: Data Analysis with AI Models

This project explores the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for analyzing car-related data. 
By leveraging Python, Pandas, and other relevant libraries, data from a CSV file (auto_data.csv) is processed, analyzed, and used to build predictive models.

Key Features of the Project:

    Data cleaning and analysis using tools like Pandas.
    Implementation of machine learning algorithms to predict specific outcomes (depending on the data).
    Analysis of correlations between various car attributes to gain insights into factors that affect price, performance, or other characteristics.
    AI-based experimentation with classification and regression models.

This project demonstrates how AI models can be applied to predict and analyze patterns in the automotive industry.
